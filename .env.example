# Hedera LazyVoter Deployment Configuration

# Deployment Order:
# 1. Deploy LazyDelegateRegistry (if not using existing one)
#    Command: node scripts/deployment/deploy-LazyDelegateRegistry.js
# 2. Deploy LazyVoter (requires registry address)
#    Command: node scripts/deployment/deploy-LazyVoter.js
#
# For test environments, you can use LAZY_DELEGATE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID
# to reuse an existing registry instead of deploying a new one.

# Hedera Network Environment

ENVIRONMENT=TEST

# Hedera Operator Credentials

# Not required for LOCAL (auto-generated operator account).
